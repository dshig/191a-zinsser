# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Dylan Shigekawa

Zinsser stresses that writing in American society 
is clutteredwith redundant and ambiguous words, which
attempt to impress or deceive. Clutter forces the 
reader to decipher what the writer is trying to say 
when it can be understood in shorter, simpler words. 
It is confusing for the reader and suggests that the 
writer cannot express thoughts clearly. Good writing 
is hard because it requires clear thinking. He 
encourages writers to analyze their work to make sure
each word serves a purpose. Just because it doesn’t
sound elegant, doesn’t mean it is less meaningful.
